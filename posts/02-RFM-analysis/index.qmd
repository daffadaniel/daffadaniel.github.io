The Project 100% completed and fully functional but the
detailed case study and walkthrough on this Quarto site are being finalized — coming in the next 1–2 days.

## Objective
Transform raw transaction data into actionable customer segments for targeted marketing campaigns.

## Methodology
- Calculated **Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM)** scores  
- Applied log transformation + standardization to handle skewness  
- Determined optimal number of clusters using **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score**  
- Trained K-Means and interpreted resulting segments

## Results
- Optimal number of clusters: **6**  
- Clear, business-friendly segment profiles identified
